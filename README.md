# --Design Process--
Designing this website, the demographic I had in mind was definitely athletic teenagers. Teenagers like bold, bright colours but at the same time like things to be minimalistic. The logo in our website can be a seen with a thick times new roman font all the time as this font gives retro vintage vibes which many teenagers would resonate with. Our dark blue and white color scheme is a result of wanting a touch of color but also wanting some sort of mroe calm neutral tone, blue was the perfect solution to that. Also as athletes they would definitely want to know what shoes their favourite players were wearing and what the latest shoe trends were. They would want to have the latest technology in shoes out and would want to get these in a quick and easy way. That's where this website comes into play, they can quickly look through our website on any device they are using be it laptop,tablet or phone and find what they like. To help them find what they like we have a filtering system here which filters through 4 different categories of all our shoes for customers to quickly pinpoint what they would like. They can add as many of these as they want to their cart and then head over to our cart and check the total price of everything they ordered and check everything out.
